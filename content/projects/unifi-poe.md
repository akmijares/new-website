With the recent rampants of scam solicitors and break-ins, my dad and I wanted to figure out a way to beef up the security around the house by adding security cameras. Since he didn't want to pay for a subscription (i.e Nest, Ring, etc.), and I wasn't really comfortable of not having complete control of our data, I was able to introduce him with the Unifi Protect ecosystem, where we got to build our own system and not be tied down to subscriptions and loss of data control. After afternoons of wiring up POE cameras, we were able to add security in areas around the house in order to monitor what goes around.
