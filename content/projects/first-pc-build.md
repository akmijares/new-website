After seeing my high school friends talk about their PC builds, I thought to myself I wanted to get into the fun. After a rabbit hole of Linus Tech Tips (and mostly from my high school co-op from NCIX), I was able to apply the knowledge on my first machine.

The CPU was an I5-4590, and the GPU was a R9380.
