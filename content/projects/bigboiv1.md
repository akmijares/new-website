After watching server videos from Linus Tech Tips, I wanted to experiment with creating a family NAS. Using the spare parts that I had, I was able to build myself a cusom NAS which runs on [Unraid](https://unraid.net/). It also hosted a Plex server to watch any locally-hosted content, and ran a few virtual machines.
