On one of my Linux SysAdmin course, we also had to deal with backing up our virtual machines, so that if something went wrong, we'd be able to revert whenever necessary. I wanted to be able to just run the backup/revert procedure with just a few keystrokes instead of typing it all one at a time. This actually helped me improve my Bash scripting and understand how it all functioned.
