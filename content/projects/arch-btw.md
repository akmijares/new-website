I wanted to keep on learning to use Linux for a long time, especially how I was easily impressed as a high school commands on the "hackery" that he was doing. I first used Linux Mint just so I can get a feel of the entire OS itself, and to see if I was comfortable using it in the future.

When I first started college, I noticed that we'd be using Linux alot more now, so I took it upon myself to start experimenting on my own.

After a bit of tinkering, I was able to install Arch Linux on a few laptops while following their wikis.
