So, I got a new laptop, which is the Framework 13, AMD Ryzen 7640.

I opted for the DIY edition, as I wanted to install my preferred RAM/storage, and plus I thought it'd be cool to set up a new laptop.

I am surprised of how light this is. My work laptop, which is a Dell Latitude 5420 is somehow way heavier than this. 

Setting up Linux was surprisingly easy, as long as you use one of their officially supported Distros, Ubuntu and Fedora. I could have tried to use one of the other Distros, however I was looking for an OS that could be more an "Out of the box" experience. 

I don't really have much else to say, other than that it's pretty awesome that I can easily repair this whenever I want, and upgrade this down the road with new CPU releases.

Good job Framework Team.
