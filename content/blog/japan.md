So a few weeks ago I went to Japan with a close friend of mine. I had fun, and I want to go back to explore more. I could talk about where I went (if your curious, [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo), [Kyoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto), [Osaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka), [Hakone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakone), and back to Tokyo) and what I did, but instead I'll say my initial thoughts when I was there for two weeks.

1. Direct flight from Toronto (YYZ) to Haneda (HND) was convenient. I would have preferred this direct route instead of going through a stopover.
2. Japanese Immigration was too long. Thank goodness I filled out their [digital declaration](https://services.digital.go.jp/en/visit-japan-web/) ahead of time.
3. The toilets were nice. Even though I came from the Philippines where bidets are common, Japan made it more "bountiful". It almost reminded me of the [South Park clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRL4l2GOqXk) that I saw a while back.
4. Japan's quiet at night. I felt comfortable walking around Tokyo at 2am.
5. I loved riding their subways, super convenient. Albeit confusing at times, but you can figure it out as you go along.
6. The IC card was like the [Presto Card](https://www.prestocard.ca/en/) but better.
7. Too many souveniers to take back. If my credit card didn't hate me, I woulda bought all of them.
8. Tokyo is what Toronto wishes it was.
9. [Tokyo Skytree](https://www.tokyo-skytree.jp/en/) was tall.
10. Alot of Anime collaborations.
11. Shibuya Crossing was big. Too bad I couldn't find [Satoru Gojo](https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Satoru_Gojo) (I'll be surprised if you get that reference).
12. The Shinkansen truly is fast, and comfortable.
13. The nature in Kyoto was a nice break.
14. The nightlife was fun. Walking around [Dotonbori](https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/2207/) felt fun.
15. Most Japanese cold and cough medicine contained [Opiods, which is banned here in Canada](https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en/alert-recall/taisho-pharmaceutical-pabron-gold-granules-unlicensed-product-product-labelled-contain).
16. Japanese Summer hated me.
17. The hot springs was actually nice.
18. I miss the [Konbinis](https://www.byfood.com/blog/culture/guide-to-konbini-japanese-convenience-stores). 7-Elevens were my go to as I could withdraw Japanese Yen for free.
19. Japanese hospitals really like to make sure you pay the fees, or else you're [banned for re-entry](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1000910/visitors-who-ditch-medical-fees-to-be-barred-from-reentering-japan).
20. The Taxis were nice.

I'm pretty sure there's more, but then again, I'm aiming to go back soon.

My recommendation is if you should go to Japan, the answer is Yes.
