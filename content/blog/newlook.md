So as you may have noticed, my personal website has a fresh look! I've always wanted to recreate this onto a more modern look.

Don't get me wrong, the previous theme helped me learn more about static site generating but it always gave me a lot of problems:

1. Too many files to keep track of, and the amount of PRs I kept getting just to keep Jekyll up to date.
2. No dark theme. That's it.
3. Whenever I try to edit it on my machine, Jekyll wouldn't work properly. Maybe I was missing something, but I couldn't exactly figure it out properly.

That's where my friend told me about [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), another static site generating tool.

So after messing around with it, I was able to land on the [blow](https://github.com/tchartron/blow) theme, which allowed me to customize the site a bit better, without all the Jekyll fuss.

I was going to deploy it on GitHub Pages, however I found another pages deployment tool, [CloudFlare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). This is actually convenient since I moved my DNS management to Cloudflare a few months ago, I was able to just add my repo to the Cloudflare pages site without any fuss, while also getting some other neat features as well (i.e, AlwaysOnline, TLS v1.3, etc.)

Take a look around, send [me](mailto:antonio.karlo@akmijares.ca) some feedback or if you just want to chat. 

I'll still keep the old site up, if you're interested in taking a look:
