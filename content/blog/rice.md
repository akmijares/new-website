Ever since PewdiePie released a video a few days ago of him showing his [Linux setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVI_smLgTY0), I got to thinking; "Should I try ricing again?"

The answer is, "Sure why not".

I mainly just use DE (Gnome on my laptop, KDE on my main computer), I'm not really a Tiling Manager guy, mostly because I'm lazy. I will probably try it at some point.

I did have a dotfiles a [few years back](https://github.com/akmijares/dotfiles?tab=readme-ov-file) for my old Thinkpad however I kept running into issues, since I was running different setups for both my laptop and machine. So I created two new repos, for seperate dotfiles. I could just sync them together however I prefer the differences, and I'd rather not run into issues again.

If you are interested in said dotfiles, they're on my Github:
1. [archyboi](https://github.com/akmijares/archyboi-dotfiles)
2. [frameboi](https://github.com/akmijares/framboi-dotfiles)

Anyway, here's my laptop rice:

I will probably cutstomize it as time goes on, but, oh boy here I go ricing again.
