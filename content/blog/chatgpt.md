So I decided to jump into the ChatGPT train and try out the AI. I won't exactly explain what it is, as it's the trending topic as I write this blog, but if you don't exactly know what it is, ChatGPT actually explains their functionality:

So I decided to test it out by asking a simple question. I'm going to Sacramento/San Fransisco in a month, and while I already had my iteniary planned out, I wanted to see what they would recommend for sightseeing at a 3 night stay in SF:

I thought, alright, let's see if they could follow up with this:

Alright they passed. It wasn't a first time for me to use an AI-based system, as I've used Voice Assistants before, since they do have some sort of AI-like functionality in it.

I decided to take it up a notch. I type into the chatbot, "How should I get into Anime?". They answered with what I would have expected:

I take it up even further, which semi-surprised me:

Then, I asked it the most complicated question I could have thought of that related to the topic, and oh boy. It took a few seconds to maybe print out a statement, but this was where I was really surprised with the results:

While there was some misinformation in it (i.e, K-On! is not a fantasy anime), I was still pleasently surprised that it recommended slice of life animes, Romantic Comedies, etc.

Here's what we should always take note of: Technology is always going to progress, no matter what. We as society are designed to evolve and explore new things, especially with AI. There was a saying back in the day that "Robots are going to take over our jobs", and, we are slowly getting there. Not everyone will like it, but it's what we're heading to nowadays, and there's no way of stopping it.
