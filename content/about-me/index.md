# About Me

My name is Antonio Karlo Mijares. I was born in the Philippines and
immigrated to Canada in May 2009. I've been living here ever since.

I've been a fan of technology since high school.
Watching [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/user/LinusTechTips) and
hearing my classmates talk about PC building is what got me hooked.

I finished my program at
[Seneca College](https://www.senecacollege.ca/home.html)
where I got my College Diploma in [Computer Networking and Technical Support](https://www.senecacollege.ca/programs/unavailable/CNS/pathways.html)
and an Advanced College Diploma in [Computer Systems Technology](https://www.senecacollege.ca/programs/fulltime/CTY.html).

Don't know where to start? Try my [Resume](/resume), and don't hesitate to
